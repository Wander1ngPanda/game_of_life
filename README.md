# TODO List

## Project: Game of Life

### Notes:

This is a functioning version of the game of life
It has a UI and will increment and progress

It needs testing and will likely benefit form refactoring and further separation of concerns. UI feels like its doing a lot of heavy lifting that could potentially be done in main or by another class

### Features to Add
- Click and Drag to Select (This has been implemented but it is terrible and needs a rethink. However it will do for now)
- Keep a cout of the generations for each run
- Allow the control of the grid size while it is open
- Control the rules of the game
- COntrol the colours of the layout
- Control the speed of the game
- Allow preset configurations to be loaded
- Allow configurations to be saved/return to starting conditions
- Use Arrow Keys to Increment
