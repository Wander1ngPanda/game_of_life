# TODO List

## Project: Game of Life

### Notes:

This is a functioning version of the game of life


### Features to Add
- Keep a count of the generations for each run
- Allow the control of the grid size while it is open
- Control the speed of the game
- Allow preset configurations to be loaded
    - Add rulesets for these configurations
    - They should be saved with all current stats with custom names
- For now focus on moving the controls to the main game
- Allow configurations to be saved/return to starting conditions
